## Making Games with Python and Pygame

This repo contains my work going through the online book [Making Games with Python and Pygame](http://inventwithpython.com/pygame/).
There is a PDF version [here](https://inventwithpython.com/makinggames.pdf), along with sources and other files [here](http://inventwithpython.com/makinggames.zip), and [errata](http://inventwithpython.com/pygame/errata).

For some of the scripts to work, you need images and whatnot from the author's archive. Unzip those into the `SOURCE` directory.
